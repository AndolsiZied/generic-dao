generic-dao
===========
In 90% of the projects I've worked on, there is a relational database, so an implementation of the dao design pattern is required.
To improve productivity and make the code more readable, it is strongly advised to factor the common methods and use generic-dao.
In this folder you will find the definition and implementation of a generic dao with the most used framewrok: Hibernate, jpa-hibernate, spring-jdbc, myBatis.
Also you find an example of use for each project.


Used technologies :
hibernate-dao : hibernate, junit, maven
jpa-hibernate : jpa, hibernate, junit, maven
mybatis-dao   : mybatis, junit, maven
spring-hibernate-dao : spring-orm, spring-test, maven
spring-jpa-hibernate-dao: spring-orm, spring-test, maven
spring-jdbc-dao : spring-jdbc, spring-test, maven
