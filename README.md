generic-dao
===========
 In 90% of the projects I've worked on, there is a relational database, so an implementation of the dao design pattern is required.<br />
To improve productivity and make the code more readable, it is strongly advised to factor the common methods and use generic-dao.<br />
 In this folder you will find the definition and implementation of a generic dao with the most used framewrok: **Hibernate**, **jpa-hibernate**, **spring-jdbc**, **myBatis**.<br />
 Also you find an example of use for each project.


 Used technologies :
 1. hibernate-dao : hibernate, junit, maven
 2. jpa-hibernate : jpa, hibernate, junit, maven
 3. mybatis-dao   : mybatis, junit, maven
 4. spring-hibernate-dao : spring-orm, spring-test, maven
 5. spring-jpa-hibernate-dao: spring-orm, spring-test, maven
 6. spring-jdbc-dao : spring-jdbc, spring-test, maven
